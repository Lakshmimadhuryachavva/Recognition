Overview :
The Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech Converter project aims to address the limitations of 
existing solutions by offering a comprehensive, user-centric platform for seamless bidirectional 
communication. 

Implementation:
Speech-to-Text:  
• Utilize the Web Speech API for speech recognition.  
• Design an intuitive interface with a text area for users to input spoken words.  
• Implement JavaScript to capture and process speech input in real-time.  
• Enhance accuracy through algorithms that handle diverse speech patterns and dialects.  
Text-to-Speech:  
• Use the SpeechSynthesis API for converting written text into spoken words.  
• Develop a responsive button to initiate the text-to-speech conversion. • Customize the 
  voice and intonation for a natural and coherent output.  
• Ensure compatibility with multiple languages and accents.
